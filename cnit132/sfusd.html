<h1>SFUSD Short Response</h1>
<p>Some of my teaching philosophy:</p>
<p>
<strong>1. Superintendent Richard Carranza has stated that the achievement gap is the greatest civil rights issue facing our district today and closing that gap is the foundation and vision for the critical work of our teachers, staff, and administrators every day. As an educator, what is your role in working towards closing the achievement gap in San Francisco? In considering the demographics of our student population, what experiences or skills make you well-positioned to close the achievement gap in the context of a diverse district such as SFUSD?</strong>
</p>
<p>
As an educator, my role in closing the achievement gap is to give every student the opportunities they need to succeed in and beyond the classroom. In addition, I would also need to be prepared for failures and to modify or make alternative plans for these students so that they may achieve some accomplishments. These small accomplishments can eventually translate to future success in the students eyes because they had someone who supported them. But I would need to remain readily available because students are going through many struggles outside of school which I have no direct control over.
</p>
<p>
I grew up and was educated in San Francisco schools. My experience working with students for the past 10+ years has given me the insight on how to approach many situations that students may be facing. With respect to each individual student's issues, I can build student rapport and have them understand that there are people who care want to see them succeed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2. How will you measure your success as a CDC or K-12 teacher, counselor, or other certificated employee? What kinds of goals will you set for the students you work with? How will you monitor your progress towards those goals throughout the year and adjust course as needed?</strong>
</p>
<p>
The goals I will set for my students will depend on the individuals. I always want my students to achieve their best. I also understand that their lives go beyond the classroom. My goal for the students would be to continue and complete their education. This will allow for options such as pursuing higher education. But foundations of the focus and responsibility required can start with me. By holding students accountable such as coming to class or completing some assignments, they can see that these goals require work on their part. This means that I will need to remain available for their assistance and adjust the tasks required for students to their abilities. With small steps and persistence, while having the support structure needed, anyone can find success in what they strive for. I will also remain proactive in checking in with all my students, because it's not just students who have major issues who are struggling.
</p>
<p>
My success can be measured by the lessons my students learn and how they apply the knowledge outside of the classroom. I want to instill the belief that my students can achieve what they strive for and build up on their small accomplishments.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3. One of your students has persistently disrupted your class. You observe this student taking things from other students, calling you names when you are turned to the chalkboard, and using inappropriate language in class. Why do you think the student might be behaving this way? How would you address this problem with the student? How would you address this problem with the student's parents or guardians?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I believe that many of the problems exhibited by students in the classroom are rooted outside of the classroom. Adolescence is a difficult time for students and many of their problems result in them acting out in the classroom.
</p>
<p>
I would address these problems with the student in a personal setting individually or with the proper support staff. I would try to find out what's going on with the student and their reasons for being disruptive. I want the student to understand that I have no malicious intentions and I remain supportive of what they can accomplish in school, but their actions are hindering this. The first time this interaction occurs would probably not be enough, but by continuing to support the student and intervene, the hope is that the student will understand that I'm on their side and want to see them do well. Also, if there are any misunderstandings, they can be clarified in a setting where the student can express themselves freely.
</p>
<p>
I would contact the student's parents or guardians when I find this issue requires intervention. I have found that most parents have the best intentions for their children and want to see their students do well. Many are also appreciative of the extra support from teachers. I would discuss the problem with the parents and see what might be the root cause that the student might not have been willing to share with me. I can also see how I could address the problems in a non-confrontational way. I want the student to know that I am willing to take the extra steps to ensure that this disruptive behavior does not continue in class. I also want the student to know that I care enough about the class to spend my extra time finding out the issue so I can adjust my own expectations and reactions when the student is disruptive.
